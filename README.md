# buntrail-protocol

Versioned framed transport contracts and validation.

## Features

Incremental decoding, bounded frames, negotiation and typed service messages.

## Usage

Add to your Cargo.toml after the initial registry release:

```toml
[dependencies]
buntrail-protocol = "0.3.0"
```

```rust
let mut decoder = buntrail_protocol::frame::Decoder::default();
assert!(decoder.push(&[], None).unwrap().is_empty());
```

Rust 1.99.1 (edition 2024).

```sh
cargo fetch
scripts/check.sh
```

## Technologies and support

Rust, Cargo. The core library is portable. Target-native acceptance must be verified separately.

API documentation is built with `cargo doc --no-deps`. Public dependency types
remain in their originating Buntrail crates; depend on those crates directly
when constructing those types. No API stability beyond the declared 0.x version
is promised. See [release instructions](docs/releasing.md).
